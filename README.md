## üì¶ Zsh Installation <a id="zsh-installation"></a> <small><a href="#table-of-contents" title="Back to top">‚Ü•</a></small>

To get started with the content of this repository, you'll need to install `zsh` and set it as your default shell.
Depending on your Linux distribution, the command to install `zsh` will vary. It can usually be found natively in various package managers.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install zsh
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install zsh
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh
```

### OpenSUSE

```bash
sudo zypper install zsh
```

### Post-installation

After installing `zsh`, you can set it as your default shell by running the following command:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Finally, for `zsh` to be applied correctly, you will need to log out (and log back in) or simply restart your system.

## üè† Introduction <a id="introduction"></a> <small><a href="#table-of-contents" title="Back to top">‚Ü•</a></small>

When we start our terminal, we will see a unique prompt:

```text
user_name@pc_name ~
```

- `user_name@pc_name`: This is the user@hostname
- `~`: This is the current directory. The `~` symbol (called a "tilde") is a shortcut for your home folder (`/home/user/`).

> **Note**: Using Powerlevel10k, you will see a visual indicator (‚úì or ‚úó) that shows whether the last command was successful or failed.

## üìÇ Basic Navigation <a id="basic-navigation"></a> <small><a href="#table-of-contents" title="Back to top">‚Ü•</a></small>

### `ls` - List files and directories

Lists the content of the current directory.

**Useful options:**

- `ls -l`: Shows a detailed list (permissions, owner, size, date).
- `ls -a`: Shows all files, including hidden ones (those starting with .).
- `ls -h`: Used with `-l`, shows the size in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).
- `ls --color`: Displays the output with colors, differentiating folders from files.

**Oh My Zsh Shortcuts:**

```zsh
alias ll='ls -l'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
```

### `cd` - Change directory

- `cd Downloads`: Go to the Downloads folder
- `cd` or `cd ~`: Return to your home folder
- `cd -`: Return to the previous directory
- `cd ..`: Go up one level
- `cd ../..`: Go up two levels

> **Tip**: Type `cd Do` and press `Tab`. Zsh will autocomplete to `Downloads/` for you.

### `pwd` - Show current directory

Shows the full path of the current directory.

```zsh
pwd
# Output: /home/user
```

## üìÅ File and Directory Management <a id="file-and-directory-management"></a> <small><a href="#table-of-contents" title="Back to top">‚Ü•</a></small>

### `mkdir` - Create directories

Create a simple directory:

```zsh
mkdir Projects
```

Create nested directories:

```zsh
mkdir -p Projects/2025/Web
```

### `touch` - Create empty files

```zsh
touch note.txt
touch app.py
```

### `cp` - Copy files and directories

Copy a file:

```zsh
cp file.txt Documents/
```

Copy and rename:

```zsh
cp file.txt file_copy.txt
```

Copy directories (use -r for recursive):

```zsh
cp -r directory/ directory_copy/
```

### `mv` - Move or rename

Rename a file:

```zsh
mv old.txt new.txt
```

Move a file:

```zsh
mv document.txt Documents/
```

Move and rename:

```zsh
mv file.txt Documents/new_name.txt
```

### `rm` - Delete files and directories

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning!** Deleted files do not go to the trash.

Delete a file:

```zsh
rm file.txt
```

Delete an empty directory:

```zsh
rmdir empty_directory/
```

Delete a directory with content (Use with caution!):

```zsh
rm -r directory_with_content/
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Day-to-Day Utilities <a id="day-to-day-utilities"></a> <small><a href="#table-of-contents" title="Back to top">‚Ü•</a></small>

```

### `grep` - Search within files

Search for "error" in .log files:
